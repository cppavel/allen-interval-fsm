1. Only adding clock does not solve issues such as p(duration) = p(overlap). Given that each of these relations
is represented by 4 symbol string, the number of paths in the clocked automata is the same for both cases. The 
number can be expressed as sum of combinations, please view combinatorics.py for the formula. Hence the probability,
is the same.
